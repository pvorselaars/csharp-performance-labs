# Roadmap

If you just want to get going, the [README](README.md) has the quick start. This file is the detailed map: what each lab teaches, what's built versus still just a sketch, and why the order is what it is.

One sequence of **fifteen labs (0–14)** that share one method (measure -> profile -> hypothesise -> change one thing -> re-measure):

- **Labs 0–8, the .NET runtime:** CPU, allocation, GC, memory, concurrency, hardware, production tooling.
- **Labs 9–14, ASP.NET Core:** the same skills under *concurrent load*, where new failure modes appear (thread-pool starvation, pool exhaustion, stampedes, retry storms, connection churn).

Beyond lab 14 there are some [specialization tracks](#specializations) planned.

Books, articles and docs for every lab: [docs/READING-LIST.md](docs/READING-LIST.md). All projects target **.NET 10**. Every lab lives in its own folder under [`labs/`](labs/), with its own README.

**Status legend:**

- ✅ built and verified (slow version fails its budgets, fixed version passes, same checksum)
- 📐 designed
- 🛠️ being built
- 💡 idea

*"Profiling skill" names the capability you need, not a specific product; see [docs/PROFILING-GUIDE.md](docs/PROFILING-GUIDE.md) for which tools (Rider, Visual Studio, the free CLI tools, `perf`) give you each one.*
## Specializations

Optional side tracks that branch off the core labs, so the core stays at fifteen labs. Each track has its own numbering, prerequisite and boss fight, and none is needed to finish Labs 0–14. Planned layout: `specializations/<track>/{exercises,solutions}`.

| Track                          | Prerequisite | Topics                                                            | Status |

| Observability                  | L9, L13      | OpenTelemetry overhead, log volume, metric cardinality, sampling  | 💡     |
| Serialization & wire formats   | L2, L5       | source generators, streaming readers, Protobuf/MessagePack        | 💡     |
| Systems design patterns        | L4, L12      | rate limiting, circuit breaker, bulkhead, idempotency, distributed locks, consistent hashing, replication/quorum | 💡     |
| Messaging & background work    | L4, L10      | `Channel<T>`, backpressure, batching, consumer lag, poison messages | 💡     |
| Startup, AOT & trimming        | L6, L13      | cold start, tiered JIT, ReadyToRun, NativeAOT                     | 💡     |

**How to work through it:** in order, 0 to 14. Each lab ends with a **final boss fight**: a disguised combination of that lab's defects with no per-defect hints (Labs 7 and 14 *are* boss labs). Labs 9–14 assume Labs 1–4; if you want ASP.NET sooner you can take Labs 9–10 right after Lab 4 and Labs 11–12 after Lab 5. Lab 6 is independent of Labs 3–5. Each lab has a **mastery checkpoint**: something to do *without notes* before moving on.
